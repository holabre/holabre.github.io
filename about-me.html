								<p>Hi! My name is Quoc. I am from East Side San Jose, California and was raised in a small ethnic enclave known as Little Saigon. Throughout my early 
								academic years, I heavily struggled learning the topics in schools which resulted in me being constantly bullied. I struggled to do well in school both socially and academically.
							However, I still progressed as a student and a person. After going to middle school at Alpha: Blanca Alvarado Middle School, I eventually became a better student in where I was my class's Valedictorian.
						More importantly, during this time I learned about the community that I was from and the struggles we all had. Rather if it was from lack of resources, gang violence, and etc, I started to realize 
					and understand more. Consequentially, it influenced me to give back to my community in any way that I saw possible. In high school, I was volunteering for any community events there was as well as 
				tutoring at a local middle school. I learned a lot from being around my community and the experiences I had and am truly blessed for all the events that has happened in my life. I knew that I wanted
			to futher represent my community and my city, and I knew the best way to do so was going to the best university. Currently, I am now studying at UC Berkeley in where I continue to learn more about myself
		and others while also representing my community and showing that despite circumstances, we can do anything we put our minds into it. Below are some highlights or random memories I want to share! Thank you.</p>
